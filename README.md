snip-dock
=========

Snip Dock, a windows utility to snip a part of the screen and snap it like a dock to the edge of the screen. Usecase: While reading up something and you need to refer to an image always

(Due to my noobness with git 2 years back, I lost previous commits on the project.)

NO LONGER MAINTAINED, as I don't have a windows machine any longer.
